# IRIS DATASET

This project uses the well-known Fisher Iris classification dataset (found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)).
The dataset was used to train a machine learning model to determine the class of irises (Iris Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica) 
based on 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width; all measured in cm.

As noted in the UCI archive, one of the classes can be distinguished linearly from the other two, but the other two cannot be
linearly distinguished from one another. 

The particular dataset has 150 entries, 50 of each class. As provided, the data has errors in the petal width of entry 35, and
has errors in the sepal width and petal length of entry 38 (noted in the UCI archive link provided).
